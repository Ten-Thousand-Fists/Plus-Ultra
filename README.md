# Plus-Ultra

Rules:
  1. We have Stand up meetings from 1:10 to 1:45, and should take no longer than 10 minutes each. The stand up meetings also have three key quesitons for each team:
      - What did I work on yesterday?
      - What am I working on today?
      - What issues are blocking me?
  2. We also used an excel workbook to create the test conditions, input values, and test cases and a word document with requirements for the webpage form we are testing. We are assigned four worksheets, and three of them we had to fill out:
      - Conditions Table
      - Condition Input Values
      - Registration Test Cases
  3. We also worked on different parts of the project itself.
      - Josh worked on the Conditions Table
      - Taylor worked on the Condition Input Values
      - I worked on the Registration Test Cases
      - We send the project to Ren and he marks the mistakes we had made.
  4. For the Registration Test Cases, we did three positive tests, while we did negative tests for each of the X's.
  5. The conditions we worked on are First Name, Last Name, Email Address, Password, Confirm Password, Address, Apt/Suite/Unit, Country, City, State, US Zip, Canada Postal, Other Postal, Phone Number, Next Button, and Provinces.
  6. There are also V60 tags for Valid Partitions, X67 tags for Invalid Partitions, B22 tags for Valid Boundaries, and D25 tags for Invalid Boundaries.
  7. This whole project is based off of a forum we need to fill out online from an event hosted by NFAR which is the annual Race for Autism.
  8. We are also using VSC to create codes to link to the Autest Website, where the forum is found.
  9. GitHub is the website we are using to create the project on, and also where we are collaborating with each other.
 10. We had automatically made some files and a folder for our project by using WebdriverIO.
